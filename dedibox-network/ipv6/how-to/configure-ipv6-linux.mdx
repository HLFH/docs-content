  - You have an account and are logged into the [Dedibox console](https://console.online.net)
  - You have [created](/dedibox/dedicated-servers/how-to/order-a-server) a Dedibox dedicated server

`systemd-networkd` is the network manager of [systemd](https://systemd.io/). It is provided natively on most Linux distributions and can be used for the configuration of IPv6 with its DHCPv6 client feature.

<Message type="tip">
  When specifying the IP address of your Dedibox, you need to enter it in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing). The netmask for the main IPv4 of a Dedibox server is `/24`, the netmask for a failover IPv4 is `/32`. The netmask for the IPv6 is `/64`.

1. Run the `ip link show` command to find the name of your public Internet interface. Make sure to store it, as it will be required in the next steps.
2. Run the following command to create a backup of the current network configuration and configure `systemd-networkd`:
    ```
    sudo mv /etc/systemd/network/eno1.network /etc/systemd/network/eno1.network.bkp
    ```
3. Run the following command to enable `systemd-networkd`.
    ```
    systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service
    ```
4. Create a new file called `<interface_name>.network` and open it in a text editor
    ```
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/eno1.network
    ```
5. Open the file in a text editor and paste the following content. Make sure to replace the values in the example with your own and save them before exiting the text editor.
    ```
    [Match]
    #The name must correspond to your interface name
    Name=eno1

    [Network]
    DHCP=ipv6
    IPv6AcceptRA=yes
    # IPv4 of the Dedibox, change netmask to /32 if failover IPv4
    Address=<ipv4_of_your_dedibox>/24
    # IPv6 of the Dedibox
    Address=2001:bc8:xxxx:xxx::x/64

    [Route]
    # The IPv4 gateway is either your Dedibox IP ending on .1 (i.e. x.y.z.1) for the physical host or 62.210.0.1 for any VM running on a Dedibox
    Gateway=<gateway_ipv4>
    GatewayOnlink=yes

    [DHCP]
    ClientIdentifier=duid-only
    DUIDType=link-layer
    # Scaleway Dedibox DUID without the DUID-LL "00:03" at the beginning
    DUIDRawData=<Online by Scaleway DUID>

    [IPv6AcceptRA]
    DHCPv6Client=always
    UseAddress=no
    WithoutRA=solicit
    UseOnLinkPrefix=False
    UseAutonomousPrefix=False
    ```
10. Run the following command to activate the new configuration.
    ```
    systemctl start systemd-networkd
    ```
